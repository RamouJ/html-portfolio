  </div>
 <div class="boxed">
<p style="font-size:130%">I am two weeks away from completing my study abroad program in Greece! While this experience had been life-changing, I am definetly looking forward to heading back to the PNW. I get a lot of questions about what we are studying abroad, and the best way to describe it is stated below. </p>
<h3 style="font-size:200%;font-family:courier new"><strong>Program Description</strong></h3>                        
<p style="font-size:130%">The program focuses on the role of travel, migration and tourism for Greece and the Balkans. These topics, and the politics behind them, are explored within social, political, economic and cultural contexts, as well as by studying the Roma communities of two Greek cities – Athens, and the picturesque resort town of Nafplion.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%">Students appreciate how Greece was constructed as a magnet destination for European and American travelers in the 19th and 20th centuries; why during the 1950s and 1960s the Greeks were forced to emigrate to Western Europe and to other western countries in search of a better life; why Greece became, especially from the 1990s onwards, a host country for immigrants from the Balkans and elsewhere; and how the phenomenon of mass tourism impacted the economy as well as the culture of Greece.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%">Within this framework some of the topics of study is the perception and representation of Greece and the Greeks by Western European and American travelers; the construction of the tourist gaze about Greece; the relation of Greece with neighboring Balkan countries, especially Albania, formerly the largest exporter of illegal immigrants to Greece; the question of human rights of the undocumented immigrants in Greece; the political and social tensions that the phenomenon of mass immigration caused in Greece; the emergence of multiple cultural identities following the arrival of immigrants but also the arrival of tourists in Greece, and the transformation of Greece from a ‘mono-cultural’ to a ‘multi-cultural’ country.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%">We will also continue our research work from the past two years on the Roma communities of Athens and Nafplion, in both learning more about their social exclusion and providing any positive assistance breaking down social barriers and exclusion.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%">This is a rich, intensive, challenging yet rewarding program that includes interviewing local residents and conducting participating observation about the issue of migration in the Balkans. We spend time conducting field-work – both in visiting sites that clarify the issue of Roma exclusion, but also in students doing holding conversations with stakeholders involved with local Roma communities. </p>
