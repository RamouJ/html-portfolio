<h1>Who am I</h1>
<p>What's good! I can be described in 3 words more or less; <b>Ambitious, Humorous, and Self-sufficient.</b>
  I am a rising sophomore at the University of Washington, and intending to study Informatics.
I have grown up in the Seattle Area almost all of my life, but my parents hail from Gambia, West Africa.
I am also the middle child in my family with an older and younger sister, so my natural desire to stand out
and diverge from the pack, is pretty much rooted in my upbringing. As well as my drive to succeed and reach my goals
so I can give back to the communities that helped to shape me into the Queen I am today.</p>
<h1>What do I do</h1>
  <p>I am a college student, so I do not have very much time outside of my studies to spend on the things I care about.
  However, when I am not in the classroom or the library, I like to spend time enjoying nature, exploring my surroundings,
excercising, learning new programming languages, and creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, such as this one!
I also love to get out in the community and work with young females and males of color, to get them thinking about STEM.</p>
<h1>What are my goals</h1>
  <p>My ultimate goals in life, include opening institutions back home in Gambia, such as schools, clinics, and markets
    to help stimulte the economy, and overall, helping more black females to fill tech and computer science roles.
    Ever since I discovered computer science and how you can create anything with it, I have made it my life mission
    to show other low-income students of color, the power of technology and how they can use Computer Science to reach thier
    wildest dreams. </p>

                                                <p>I have always loved designing webpages and I wanted to create something that could display my knowledge of front-end web design. I began by coding in HTML, then used W3 schools to add cool features and such. I also used some javaScript and CSS to add motions and animations.</p>
